### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Mateusz
#### I am a 20-year-old programmer.
I started my adventure with web development 2 years ago, in technical school on the profile of IT technician.
I graduated from school with the title of IT technician.

Over time, I realized that creating websites gives me fun, so while still in school I taught myself at home, developed the assigned projects and also created my own.
