### Hi there 👋, my name is Mateusz

#### 

#### I am a 20-year-old programmer.
I am this year's high-school graduate, graduated from high school with the title of IT Technician, I have been dealing with Web Devlopment for 2 years now. I develop my skills largely on my own, I use various sources, including YouTube, 
Scrimba platform and minor Crash Course.

I am looking for my first job as a Front-End Developer.
I have completed several projects in "pure" JavaScript as well as React with TypeScript support.

I have completed the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) [Front-End Developer Career Path](https://github.mndev.eu/Certificates/blob/main/Scrimba/The%20Frontend%20Developer%20Career%20Path), [Advanced React](https://github.com/Malelus/Certificates/blob/main/Scrimba/Advanced%20React), [JavaScript deep dive](https://github.com/Malelus/Certificates/blob/main/Scrimba/JavaScript%20deep%20dive) and [React Hooks Simplified](https://github.mndev.eu/Certificates/blob/main/Web%20Dev%20Simplified/React%20Hooks%20Simplified) course from [Web Dev Simplified](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified).
